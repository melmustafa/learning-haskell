# Haskell

## Introduction

Haskell is a purely functional programming language which means that any function will only depends on its arguments and nothing else can affect the output of the function. For example in an OOP paradigm when we have a class with setters the setters have an effect since they modify something that was not passed in explecitly (it was passed in implicity)
